HW Assignment:
- Make 3 leds blinks on the breadboard. A red led that blinks 5 times, a green led that blinks 10 times, and a blue led that blinks 15 times

Takeaway from Lesson 3:
- Pins on arudino gives voltage
- You need to set resistor on the same circuit level(?) as the voltage
- From the other end of the resistor, connect to the Long side of the led. The short side connects to ground.
- (+) is voltage and (-) is ground
